## üìò Reflection

This onboarding project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- **Writing and organizing tests** using `pytest`, including async client tests and schema validation.
- **Debugging access issues and JWT token logic**, which deepened my understanding of OAuth2 flows.
- **Mocking external services** like SMTP to test email flows without relying on external servers.
- **Schema validation** using Pydantic, including how test fixtures reflect model structures.

On the collaboration side, I learned how to **track progress with GitHub issues**, link them to code, and write clearer documentation to communicate intent. This workflow prepares me to work more effectively in collaborative and production environments.
